--> This package (ref. [1] study) contains 2 folders:

1. 'Functions': MATLAB codes.

2. 'WORKSPACE': Directory where the inputs and outputs of experiments are 
    saved. It should contain five files. 
       - 'outcome.mat': lung metastases status. 
       - 'contour_Mass.mat': number in the RTstruct DICOM objects 
          correspondingto the ROI without edema for each patient.
       - 'contour_Edema.mat': number in the RTstruct DICOM objects 
          corresponding to the ROI with edema for each patient. 
       - 'masterScript_STS.m': MATLAB master script to reproduce the 
          experiments of ref. [1]. 
       - 'masterScriptExample_STS.m': faster example version of 
          masterScript_STS.m.



INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download the imaging data from The Cancer Archive Imaging (TCIA) website
   at: <http://dx.doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.7GO2GSKS>. The data is 
   automatically saved in a folder named 'Soft-tissue-Sarcoma'.

2. Move the 'Soft-tissue-Sarcoma' folder in the 'WORKSPACE' folder.

3. Set up the MATLAB path to contain all sub-folders of the folder 'Functions'
   of this package (ref. [1] study), and all sub-folders of the folders 
   'MultivariableModeling', 'NontextureFeatures', 'TextureToolbox' and 
   'Utilities' of the <https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics/> package.
    
4. Run 'masterScript_STS.m' in MATLAB from the 'WORKSPACE' folder (run 
   'masterScriptExample_STS.m' for a faster example version).



NOTES:

- IMPORTANT: Multivariable modeling codes will be put online during the week 
  of June 8, 2015, and will be added to the master scripts. 
  (Martin Vallières - June 1, 2015)

- Over time, some codes have been improved since the creation of this package
  (e.g., better ROI definition). Results may slightly  differ compared to what 
  is found in ref. [1].

- Running 'masterScript_STS.m' on a single CPU core will take a very long time. 
  It is suggested to paralellize the computation of the following codes:
     --> calcAllSeparateTextures_STS.m, calcAllFusedTextures_STS.m: use
         patient-wise parallelization, for example.

- This software code have up to now been tested in a Linux OS (Ubuntu 14.04) 
  using Matlab R2013b. It is expected to run fine in any Unix-based OS, but 
  probably not in Windows due to differences in path definition and command
  line functions. Windows-compatible code is currently a work in progress.
