*** THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS PACKAGE ***
--> If you have any questions, comments or suggestions about this package, 
    please do not hesitate to contact me!


This package contains 5 folders:

1. 'TextureToolbox': MATLAB codes to perform texture analysis from an input 
    2D or 3D region of interest (ROI). This toolbox is self-contained and 
    can be used on its own outside of the radiomics package. In particular,
    this texture analysis package implements wavelet band-pass filtering, 
    isotropic resampling, discretization length corrections and different 
    quantization tools. Please see ref. [1] for more details.


2. 'NonTextureFeatures': MATLAB codes to compute features other than texture
    from an input 3D region of interest (ROI). Include features such as SUV 
    metrics, AUC-CSH, Percent Inactive, Size, Solidity, Volume and Eccentricity. 
    Please see ref. [1] for more details.


3. 'MultivariableModeling': MATLAB codes to perform multivariable analysis
    operations such as logistic regression, bootstrapping, feature set 
    reduction, feature set selection, prediction performance estimation,
    permutation tests, etc.

--> IMPORTANT: These codes will be put online during the week of June 8, 2015.
    (Martin Vallières - June 1, 2015)


4. 'Utilities': MATLAB codes used to perform different operations including
    the computation of SUV maps, 3D resampling, conversion of RTstruct DICOM
    objects to 3D masks, 3D resampling, etc.


5. 'STUDIES': MATLAB codes used for specific studies. To reproduce the 
    experiments of a given study, please see its corresponding folder.
   
    - 'STSstudy': Ref. [1]. Imaging data and clinical information is 
       available on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) website under the 
       following DOI: <http://dx.doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.7GO2GSKS>.
