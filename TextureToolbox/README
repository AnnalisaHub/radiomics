INPUTS:

1. 2D or 3D volume in MATLAB format (.mat) 
2. Mask of dimensions corresponding to the volume in MATLAB format.
   The mask contains 1's in the region of interest (ROI), and 0's 
   elsewhere.



INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Set MATLAB path to all subfolders of /Texture_Toolbox and /Utilities directories, which can be
   found at: <https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics/>

2. Prepare the input volume for texture analysis (isotropic resampling, quantization, etc.) by 
   running 'prepareVolume.m'. Please see ref. [1] for more details.

% EXAMPLE:                                                                                     % 
% Let a PET scan be defined by 'volume', with 'mask' defining the region of interest           % 
% (ROI). The PET scan has in-plane resolution of 4 mm, with slice thickness of 3.27 mm.        %
%                                                                                              %
% 1. To prepare 'volume' for matrix-based texture analysis at a scale of 5 mm, without WBPF,   %
%    using a Lloyd-Max quantization algorithm with 32 gray-levels, run:                        %
%                                                                                              %
%    [ROIonly,levels] = prepareVolume(volume,mask,'PETscan',4,3.27,1,5,'Matrix','Lloyd',32);   %
%                                                                                              %  
%    Next, use 'ROIonly' and 'levels' as inputs to 'getGLCM.m','getGLRLM.m', 'getGLSZM.m'      %
%    or 'getNGTDM.m'.                                                                          % 
%                                                                                              % 
%                                                                                              %
% 2. To prepare 'volume' for global texture analysis at a scale equal to the in-plane          %   
%    resolution, with R=2, run:                                                                %
%                                                                                              %
%    [ROIonly] = prepareVolume(volume,mask,'PETscan',4,3.27,2,'pixelW','Global);               %
%                                                                                              %
%    Next, use 'ROIonly' as input to 'getGlobalTextures.m'.                                    % 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

3. For Global textures, run:
   - [textures] = getGlobalTextures(ROIonly,100); % Here, using 100 bins for histogram computation.
 
4. For matrix-based textures, run:
   - [GLCM] = getGLCM(ROIonly,levels); [textures] = getGLCMtextures(GLCM);
   - [GLRLM] = getGLRLM(ROIonly,levels); [textures] = getGLRLMtextures(GLRLM);
   - [GLSZM] = getGLSZM(ROIonly,levels); [textures] = getGLSZMtextures(GLSZM);
   - [NGTDM,countValid] = getNGTDM(ROIonly,levels); [textures] = getNGTDMtextures(NGTDM,countValid);
